📝 Plagiarism Detection System (NLP Mini Project)
Project Overview

This mini project implements a Plagiarism Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The system identifies whether a given text is original or plagiarized using machine learning techniques.

     Features

Uses TF-IDF vectorization for converting text into numerical features

Trains a Logistic Regression classifier to detect plagiarism

Provides evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

Visualizes results using heatmaps

Can detect word-for-word plagiarism and is extendable to paraphrased text

    Dataset

The project includes a CSV dataset (plagiarism_dataset.csv) containing 50 text samples

    Labels:

0 → Original text

1 → Plagiarized text

    Sample:

text,label
"Machine learning allows computers to learn patterns from data.",0
"This document is copied word for word from an existing article.",1

    Project Workflow

>Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal

>Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization

>Model Training: Logistic Regression classifier

>Prediction & Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

>Visualization: Heatmap of the confusion matrix

    Future Enhancements

Expand dataset to include real-world plagiarism cases

Detect paraphrased or semantic plagiarism using advanced embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT)

Build a GUI or web interface for user-friendly plagiarism checking
